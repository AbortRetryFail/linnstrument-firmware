LinnStrument
============

This is the firmware for LinnStrument, running on an Arduino Due processor.

To build these sources yourself, make sure to first read arduino_fixes/README.md, otherwise you will get compilation errors.

These sources assume that you're using Arduino IDE v1.6.5 with SAM boards v1.6.4. Later versions of these packages have known problems.
